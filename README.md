## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is a simple web application showcasing my command of HTML and CSS.

## The challenge

The main challenge here is laying out the cards in a diamond like pattern.

## My solution

First, I created the four cards in a column for a clean mobile view. Then, when the screen becomes big enough, I arranged the main section with the diamond like pattern using CSS grid.
The grid is comprised by 3 x 2 columns and rows and from the, it was just a matter of plotting the cards according to their position.

## Technologies used

- HTML - Used to create the index.html file
